This repository holds a middleware used in the hosted environment @ Aksio.

## Running locally

The middleware can be run by navigating to the `./Source` folder and do:

```shell
dotnet run
```

For testing the middleware in a reverse proxy situation, you can run the Docker Compose in `./Sample`:

```shell
docker compose up
```

This will give you a reverse proxy set up on port 8080. Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Auth

The middleware is meant to be plugged into reverse proxy solutions such as Nginx. By leveraging something like the
[auth capability of Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html) the middleware will be
called on every request going in and will then mutate the response if needed.

## Tenant-ID

Part of the middleware is to provide the correct `Tenant-ID` HTTP header as required by [Cratis](https://github.com/aksio-insurtech/Cratis).
It is used internally to map the current **execution context** to the current tenant for the request going in.

The `Tenant-ID` is mapped based on the domain host name which is configured in the config file. Based on the requests domain name, the correct `Tenant-ID` will be set.

To test the `Tenant-ID` injection in the response you can simply add your configured hosts to the operating systems hosts file to point to localhost/127.0.0.1 and then navigate to the URL + port 8080 with the sample reverse proxy setup.

## Id-Porten

The support for Id-Porten is based on a container app setup of a custom ingress that sits in front of the ingress for a Container App.
Its purpose is to provide support for multi tenancy for this specific identity provider by adding on the custom `onbehalfof` based on
a domain configuration for the tenant. It uses the domain name configured in the config as a basis to understand which value to set.

Below is the target flow it has been designed for:

You can read more about the `onbehalfof` support for Id-porten [here](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/idporten/oidc/oidc_api_admin_leverand√∏r.html#1-onbehalfof-i-id-porten) (Norwegian,
English OIDC summary can be found [here](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/idporten/oidc/oidc_guide_english)).

## Config File

All configuration is done through a well known file called `config.json` sitting in the `config` folder next to the binaries of the middleware.
To override it in a running environment all you need to do is mount a volume that overrides either the `config` folder or the specific `config/config.json` file.

Its format is:

```json
{
    "idPorten": {
        "issuer": "The URL for the issuer, typically where the /.well-known/openid-configuration sits",
        "authorizationEndpoint": "The Id-porten authorization endpoint"
    },
    "tenants": {
        "<tenant guid>": {
            "domain": "fully qualified host string",
            "onBehalfOf": "Value to use for id-porten as behalf of",
            "sourceIdentifiers": []
        }
    },
    "tenantResolution": {
        "strategy": "route | claim",
        "options": {}
    },
    "identityProviderUrl": "The URL to call to get application details for the identity",
    "OAuthBearerTokens": {
        "authority": "The URL for the well-known document that describes the authority"
    }
}
```

### Tenant resolution

Within every tenant you'll see an optional array of source identifiers (`sourceIdentifiers`).
These are strings that can will be matched with a value provided by a source identifier provider.
If a tenant has a source identifier in its array, that tenant will become the tenant selected.

You can also use the host name as a matching criteria, which is specified as `domain` in the configuration file.
If no source identifier provider is specified, or they are not able to resolve and the `domain` value is set
it will match the tenant on this.

#### Route source identifier provider

Route values can be extracted using regular expression to provide a source identifier that will be mapped.
In the regular expression you will have to provide an expression that contains a named group. If an expression
is matched, it will use the named groups value as the source identifier for matching up the tenant.

Below shows an example:

```json
{
    "tenantResolution": {
        "strategy": "route",
        "options": {
            "regularExpression": "\/(?<sourceIdentifier>[\\w]+)\/"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Claim source identifier provider

You can configure using claims on the principal in the `x-ms-client-principal` as the source identifier for
resolving a tenant. The claim-type supported for this is the one defined by Microsoft for tenant (http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid).

Below shows an example:

```json
{
    "tenantResolution": {
        "strategy": "claim",
        "options": { }
    }
}
```

### OAuth Bearer Tokens

The `OAuthBearerToken` configuration is optional. It won't run any authorization if the config is left out.

> Note: The specific identity provider configurations are optional. You can have either or all.

### Identity Details

The result coming from the application specific identity details endpoint called ends up as a cookie with the string representation of what was returned.
The cookie name is `.aksio-identity`.
